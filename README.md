# discord-screenshot-emulator

An unorganized set of Python scripts to take a chat log (that was generated by a separate machine learning setup) and make it look like a real Discord screenshot.

## Why?

Because the chat logs that were generated by a friend were really funny, and I wanted to make it look like my friends and I actually said those things.

## Why don't you organize this project?

Because I don't need to. It was code hacked together for fun.
