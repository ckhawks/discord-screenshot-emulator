#carter #carter #carter                                       , I've found a way to do it
[29-Jul-19 09:01 PM] directive#1000
it's a weird one
[29-Jul-19 09:01 PM] directive#1000
you can put a label on it and add some sort of text
[29-Jul-19 09:01 PM] directive#1000
but the whole thing would be too big
[29-Jul-19 09:02 PM] directive#1000
so i made it a button
[29-Jul-19 09:02 PM] directive#1000
and it has the same effect
[29-Jul-19 09:02 PM] directive#1000
but instead of just doing that
[29-Jul-19 09:02 PM] directive#1000
it adds clickable links to all of your stuff
[29-Jul-19 09:02 PM] directive#1000
and it adds a button to your news feed
[29-Jul-19 09:02 PM] directive#1000
so people can see all of your stuff
[29-Jul-19 09:02 PM] directive#1000
people will probably just take the default
[29-Jul-19 09:02 PM] directive#1000
and just click it
[29-Jul-19 09:03 PM] directive#1000
and voila
[29-Jul-19 09:03 PM] directive#1000
it works for me
[29-Jul-19 09:03 PM] directive#1000
but it would make the site way too big for my liking
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
i want to be able to change what the "default" is at any time
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
so i can't really do it
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
but it's a start
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
and then the design can change as well
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
the backend would be the same for both of us
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
so we could make something cool
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
and then the frontend could be anything
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
but we would both be using the same backend
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
so it would be like a single product
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
but separate product trees would work just fine
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
also jp is a cedar
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
and he's been using discord for like a year
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
so it would be easy to revert
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
or change the default backend
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
change the server, or disable it altogether
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
if you disable discord then you become a reseller, which is illegal in trentens
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
if something breaks on your server then you become a trenten
[29-Jul-19 09:04 PM] directive#1000
we are the service, not the product
[29-Jul-19 09:05 PM] directive#1000
and then voila voila voila
[29-Jul-19 09:05 PM] directive#1000
we are the service, not the product
[29-Jul-19 09:05 PM] directive#1000
theres only two products
[29-Jul-19 09:05 PM] directive#1000
one is a fucking broken product
[29-Jul-19 09:05 PM] directive#1000
the other one is cool
[29-Jul-19 09:05 PM] directive#1000
theres only two products
[29-Jul-19 09:05 PM] directive#1000

[29-Jul-19 09:05 PM] directive#1000
